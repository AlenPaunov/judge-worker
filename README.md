# judge-worker

judge-worker is a collection of open source assemblies for compiling, executing and checking tests for submissions, written in different programming languages.

Consist of:
* Restricted process executor using Windows APIs
* Compiler wrappers and checkers
* Base Service class that starts multiple submission processors which on their end execute the core logic on the submission and return an execution result, that can be handled by your own processing strategy.

### ðŸ”Œ Usage
  1. Include the repository as a submodule in your project.
  2. Create a Windows service that implements `LocalWorkerServiceBase`. This base class starts a predefined number of threads which start that many submission processors. You have the option to plug logic that will be executed once before starting the threads, overriding the `BeforeStartingThreads()` method (at the end you must call it's `base`).
  3. Create a class that implements `SubmissionProcessingStrategy`. This is where the logic for processing the execution result for your application should reside. Implementing this base class, you have access to a single concurrent queue that is shared between all the submission processors and you can use it for stroing and retrieving submissions.
  4. Create a Dependancy container of your choosing which should implement `IDependancyContainer` and register your `SubmissionProcessingStrategy` in it.
  5. Pass the container to the `GetDependancyContainer()` method of the `LocalWorkerServiceBase` and to the `ObjectFactory.InitializeServiceProvider()` method in the entry point of your service.
  6. Add the corresponding appSettings of the `OJS.Workers.Common.Settings` in the App.config of your service.
  7. Install and Start your Windows service.
